## Two most common types of APIs:
- Web APIs (REST)
- Platform APIs (Java, C++, etc.)

## Documentation
### API Conceptual Material

Conceptual Material Consists of:
- Overview
  - Explain **why** to use the API
    The overview must explain why you would use it
    - Describe key features
    - Provide a few use cases

  - List Requirentments for the API
    - Provide a list of what is required.
    - Get this list from the development team.
    - For Web APIs:
      - This usually isn't included
      - However, for some APIs, you need a separate authentication server. 


  - Key Concepts
  - Explain Workflow: what are the most common steps to do common tasks.
  - Diagrams - a good place for visual information: architechture diagrams and/or data model diagrams
