# Postman Collections
- A collection is a folder that stores all the requests related to an API or they are somehow related to one another.

- Variable:
  - current value - a value used by Postman; privat to your account, no one else can see the current values.
  - initial value - important for sharing; can/should be overwritten, replaced with a placeholder when sharing sensitive data.
